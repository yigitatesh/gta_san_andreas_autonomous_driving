# Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Autonomous Driving
Autonomous driving in the game "Grand Theft Auto San Andreas".


# Summary
There are two autonomous driving car models. <br>
* First one is a simple car that is detecting two road lanes and decide what to do according to them. <br>
* Second model is based on a **CNN** deep learning model.

## Simple Car model
It is based on road lanes and makes decisions by looking at road lanes. <br>
Not AI based.

## CNN model
This model is trained by 45.000 images that are generated by a real user while he is playing the video game. 
All the images are in grayscale format to make learning and predicting simpler for the deep learning model. <br>
The program takes a screenshot of the game window and predicts the best move for that time according to the predictions of the CNN model.


# Requirements
## For Simple Car model (simple_car.py)
- opencv
- mss
- win32api
## For CNN Model (run_model.py)
- tensorflow-gpu

- tflearn
- opencv
- mss
- win32api


# How to Run

## Simple car model
Run simple_car.py. <br>
Open "GTA San Andreas" video game in fullscreen mode.
## CNN model
Run run_model.py. <br>
Open "GTA San Andreas" video game in fullscreen mode.
